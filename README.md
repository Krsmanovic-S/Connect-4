# Connect 4
 Connect 4 implemented in Python using **Pygame**. Currently features an AI opponent that plays randomly. In the future I will implement the minimax algorithm for the AI to use, as well as other features like PvP, switching colors, fully functional options menu and so on. For now a basic menu is in place that works, it will be expanded later. The sprites for buttons, the logo and the font are not my own, they were downloaded for free from the internet.
